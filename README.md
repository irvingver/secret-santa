### Description


### Preface
There are many different ways to solve this problem and you are free to choose how to solve the problem using whatever 
technologies and patterns you feel are appropriate. We are looking for good code and software design; it's up to you to 
decide what that is. We expect this will take you somewhere between 1-3 hours to complete, so we aren't expecting 
"perfect" code (if there is such a thing). If you find yourself stuck or spending too much time on the problem, send us 
what you have with an explanation of what you would have done.


#### Here are a few things to keep in mind:
- Your code should be easily readable, commented, and maintainable.
- Try to include unit tests to validate your application's functionality (edge cases, regular operation, etc). 
  You don't need 100% code coverage.
- Feel free to use any build tools or libraries you are comfortable with (even AI!).
- There aren't any restrictions on how you come up with your solution, but be prepared to discuss it.
- Please document how to build & run your solution.

### Problem Statement
Imagine your extended family does a "Secret Santa" gift exchange yearly. For this gift exchange, each person randomly 
draws another person and gets a gift for them.\
After the third year of doing the Secret Santa gift exchange, you hear complaints about having the same Secret Santa 
for multiple years.\
As your extended family has grown, members have married and had children. Those families usually get gifts for their 
immediate family members, so they would like to have their immediate family excluded from the Secret Santa.


### Homework

Write a program that will choose a Secret Santa for your extended family, given these constraints:

- A person cannot be their own Secret Santa.
- A family member can only be paired with the same Secret Santa once every three years.
- Immediate Family Members cannot select other members of their immediate family.

### Next Steps

One of your next interviews with BetterCloud will be a panel interview with 2 BetterCloud Engineers. 
During this interview, be prepared to discuss your solution. If itâ€™s helpful for you to share your screen while talking 
about your solution, be prepared to do so.
